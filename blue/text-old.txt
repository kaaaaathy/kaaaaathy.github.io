a color suffers from a name. a color is a color as long as you call it. can you move it, ship by weight? i will walk around the color and show you. the color wants to go to market. light wants to wait. one finds the other at a loss for words. cobalt, lapis. ultramarine. the sky wasnt blue without a box to look through. vermeer finds beautiful clothing for mary. shades of Prussian are more blood than nation and a name suffers from place. or rather, discovery. English found this last. a computer screen blinks in light a blue refusal. virtual loves to hide a supply chain, they cant make lithium fast enough, appliances love to hide a hole, cobalt is the sound on the roof of your mouth. it is digging, faster. a border closes around somewhere that is not here, and needs the technology of words, too. my childhood school bus drove by a used car lot obscured by trees, you couldn't see cars but on a sunny day they would sparkle. like water. metal is no mother. the wrong things become exotic. you think blue is more velvet but it is made of hard things. they wanted to build a tunnel to china but china was busy eating the congo. the glaze whispering, infinity. is the virtual a dream or still tethered to supply chain? made of steel silica sand gold bauxite, supply and demand and demand, close your eyes and see it still.
