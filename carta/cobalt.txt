Introduction of metasomatic fluids further extended the biotite halo, flooding the system with k and fe, and adding orthoclase to the biotite hornfels assemblage.  This assemblage replaced much of the protolith regardless of original composition.  Continued metasomatism at high temperature (300C - 550C) formed garnet and pyroxene in calcareous rocks and overprinted the biotite-orthoclase hornfels. Sulfide minerals, dominated by pyrrhotite, began to precipitate with the garnet-pyroxene skarn and continued as temperatures declined.  Gold mineralization began at 300C-400C and continued to lower temperatures along with minor arsenopyrite, pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, galena, bismuth, and tellurides.  During cooling of the hydrothermal system, the garnet-pyroxene skarn was altered to actinolite, prehnite, and chlorite.""",,,,"""Paidakovich, Matthew E."", ""Beougher, Dee (Spanski, Gregory T.)"", ""Schruben, Paul G."", ""Skurski, M.

Replacement and open-space filling by silica minerals are the most prominent and diagnostic alteration styles at Sleeper. Early silicification, accompanied by pyrite, resulted in pervasive replacement of plagioclase phenocrysts and groundmass by opaline silica. Alunite occurs in some early silicified rocks, but possibly was a later addition. Silicification of several types accompanied ore stages. Late-stage silicification in the form of opal is controlled by post-ore faults and fractures and is barren of gold. This late opal typically contains abundant light-colored alunite, kaolinite, or jarosite. Small amounts of native sulfur are enclosed in the late silica. Hypogene argillic alteration occurs peripheral to zones of early silicification; commonly there is a transition zone from 3 to 50 m wide of clay-altered plagioclase in silicified groundmass. The broad argillized zones are barren of Ag and Au, and contain little sulfide and no silica veinlets. Feldspar phenocrysts and aphanitic groundmass in argillized zones commonly are altered to clay minerals, most commonly kaolinite, smectite, and illite. Plagiocalse phenocrysts have been replaced by fine-grained clay minerals and alunite. Sanidine is locally altered to sericite or kaolinite. Groundmass is generally altered to very fine grained silica-clay mixtures. Thoroughly acid-leached rocks with sponge-like texture of more than 90% silica occur in local zones along post-ore faults.  Subsequently, opal, alunite, and jarosite were deposited in the porous rocks. \nThe prominent red coloration of upper pit walls reflects supergene destruction of sulfides and local redistribution of iron into fractures. Pyritic tuffs have been oxidized to tan alunite+jarosite+limonite-bearing mixtures. Feldspars are altered to white clays along open fractures and voids later filled by phases of unusual composition, some rich in Cl (as NaCl and AgCl), and various combinations of Al, Mn, and Co As oxides or sulfates. \n\nPropylitically altered tuffaceous sediments, andesitic lava flows, and metasedimentary basement rocks underlie the rhyolitic host rock.","hydrothermal fluids in hot spring system.","West Wood, Bedrock Casino, Northeast areas, Sleeper Pit, Wood Pit","Brittle rocks (mainly rhyolite porphyry) were required for deposition of gold in open tension fractures and as stockwork veins and hydrothermal breccias.","Paidakovich, Matthew E., La Pointe, D.D.
