## Recipe for Erotic Event Listeners üåπ

This recipe is inspired by a tradition of computational & digital poetry, as well as by feminist writers who write about love, pleasure, and healing. This is a template and starting point for building a simple digital love poem focused on opacity/transparency, and click/touch interactions. 

We can play with the browser space as a world of play, poetry, and pleasure even. As users of computational machines we spend minutes if not hours of everyday clicking, swiping, touching the <body> of a webpage. Let‚Äôs pretend for a moment that the cursor is my hand, or body, seemingly immaterial, floating. Can a hover state be a gaze, or a click be a caress?

## Full Description

This recipe is inspired by a tradition of computational and digital poetry, as well as by feminist writers who write about love, pleasure, and healing.

Audre Lorde, in [Uses of the Erotic](https://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/11881_Chapter_5.pdf), writes:
 >‚ÄúWhen I speak of the erotic, then, I speak of it as an assertion of the lifeforce of women; of that creative energy empowered, the knowledge and use of which we are now reclaiming in our language, our history, our dancing, our loving, our work, our lives.‚Äù

In adrienne maree brown‚Äôs book [Pleasure Activism](https://www.akpress.org/pleasure-activism.html), brown encourages ways that a pleasure practice can be healing:
 >‚ÄúI touch my own skin, and it tells me that before there was any harm, there was miracle.‚Äù 

Within capitalist regimes we are told we feel love and pleasure in the wrong ways, and the systems prefer everything to be subject to economies of scarcity. Particularly individuals of intersectionally oppressed identities aren‚Äôt seen as belonging with the idea of pleasure at all‚Äîdoing it in the wrong ways, ways which are stigmatized and also criminalized. 

And of course there‚Äôs all the ways in which the act of writing about love‚Äîespecially romantic and erotic love‚Äîis also seen as an inferior genre to other kinds of writing  because of the way these things are gendered. 

Within the traditions of material and concrete poetics, we might gently resist what this web space might be for. For instance, here‚Äôs an example of [digital love letters from 1999](https://anthology.rhizome.org/skinonskinonskin), which plays with how the cursor dances across skin:

We can play with the browser space as a world of play, poetry, and pleasure even. As users of computational machines we spend minutes if not hours of everyday clicking, swiping, touching the body of a webpage. Let‚Äôs pretend for a moment that the cursor is my hand, or body, seemingly immaterial, floating. Can a hover state be a gaze, or a click be a caress?

Writing about love can often invite a kind of discretion, secrecy, for a number of different reasons‚Äîthink pillow books, innuendos. This recipe is also inspired by modes of secret writing. In the browser, to be literally transparent means to hide away. To be opaque in our expression, means to show all. You might also play with visibility, legibility.

**Who is it for?**
This recipe is a simple and humble one. It‚Äôs aimed at people who are just starting out their understanding with ‚Äúhow the browser is built,‚Äù that offers a playful way to think about ‚Äútouch‚Äù and ‚Äúclick‚Äù and toggling the appearance of a DOM element. Making websites from scratch too, can be a radical act of moving away from the nonconsensual transactions, constraints, and terms of service set out by today's software empires. 

Here is the [basic example](https://kaaathy.com/covertpoems/index.html):

## Instructions
  
### 1. Write a love poem:
* If it‚Äôs easier, write it not as a poem, but as a list. 
* If you'd like structure, consider traditional poetry formats, e.g. 14 lines in the rough structure of a sonnet. Or 5 lines for a haiku. 
* Perhaps it‚Äôs someone you fancy, with whom you want to be discreet. Perhaps this poem is dedicated to yourself, or a part of the body.
* What do you love about this part of the body?
* You can think about erotic love, and think about verbs that you would like to include. You can stay within a realm of romantic, platonic, or other kinds of love. Whatever is more comfortable. 
* Maybe you start every line with a different verb [‚Äútouch,‚Äù ‚Äútaste‚Äù, ‚Äústroke‚Äù]. Maybe you start every line with the word ‚Äúyou‚Ä¶‚Äù
* For net-based written inspiration, consider [Craigslist Missed Connections](https://newyork.craigslist.org/d/missed-connections/search/mis) (go with discretion...) or erotic Fan Fiction sites...

### 2. Download the [template.zip](https://github.com/kathymakes/kathymakes.github.io/blob/master/covertpoems/template.zip) and unzip it.
 
### 3. In the code:

* The template.zip should include ‚Äúindex.css,‚Äù ‚Äúindex.html,‚Äù ‚Äúscript.js.‚Äù Open all three files in a text editor of your choice. Download here: 
 
* Beginning in **script.js**: On line 1, after the equal sign ‚Äúlet desires = ‚Ä¶‚Äù, replace the data with your own poem. Think about if you want to split it up on every line break, or on every word...

* On line 16: If you would like, you can change the event listener ‚Äúclick‚Äù to other kinds of events. Mouseover, mousedown‚Ä¶ here is a full list of all event listeners: [HTML DOM Event Object Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)
  
* **In index.html**: On line 15, between the h1 brackets, replace the title of the poem with your own. What instructions might you give to someone reading this poem?
* **In index.css**: On line 3, change the background image to be the name of your own image file. Maybe it‚Äôs something that reminds you about the person/idea you are writing to, or maybe it‚Äôs something completely random and meant to disguise the website from your intended audience.

This is just meant to be a starting point, but perhaps you want to play with other structures entirely. Here is a [love poem builder](https://kaaathy.com/digpo/may.html) that I made back in 2014, if you want to see other kinds of interactivity.
