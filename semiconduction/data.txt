1—
they say the Chinese
are good at copying—
students at the Art Academy of Beijing
detail the same oil painting of
two sunflowers, a pear,
off-brand tributes to Van Gogh—
each brush stroke a brightness
without a name.


2—
the factory knows her face
and the windows have teeth
she spends her twelve hours
telling the same screw
where to live—
a sinew between speaker
and motherboard
at night, on break
she sends her voice
to her hometown. she tells the moon a wish
about a holiday.
she tells the moon a whisper
about a raise.




3—
in Shanghai,
iPhone factory workers live
eight to a dorm.
a TechInsider reporter says,
in English:
they play games in the bunks.
they watch TV.
they have unique personalities.






4—
i feel it in the fervor
with which i replaced mother tongue
with English—
copying lexicon from new culture
installing it into my body.
Beethoven, Bach.
small yellow fingers play pianissimo,
staccato; the speed of
my mother dreaming in SATs.
in English, the sounds are
more metal than mother—
Kathys
and Amys
and Jennifers
and Emilys—
amulets to protect us
in the new land.

5—
many are the only ones in their families to go.
they will tell their children it was meritocracy.
but they were also born in the right place
in the right year.
tech workers with degrees
making American children,
with American dreams.


6—
my mother draws
lines on black screens
geometries intertwined and laying orthogonal
to the other
the finished product is even smaller
than the white moon of your fingernail,
even smaller
than breath at the end
of a score


7—
the machines fall into notation. eighths, quarters.
the image she weaves is silicon, so to tell time, or count.

8—
you will never know me, but
we have touched each other
through semi-conduction, this
invisible thread, these
global markets—
migrant worker weaving
mother’s
design, handling between
latex finger and thumb
something like lace,
something like,
mothers, and daughters,
and daughters,
and daughters.


9—
we will abstract them all away to machines —
due not to cruel personal intention 
but because corporations maintain veil as power
that they can cannibalize without being seen.
transforming bodies into market share.
the machinery keeps going.
the similarities we see
are not coincidental.
they are statistic.
millions of Chinese children
with bowl cut hair
installing Fur Elise into
their bodies
at the same time.
