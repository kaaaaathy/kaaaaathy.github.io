  MFA thesis project for Brown University Literary Arts program, 2024. Advised by Sawako Nakayasu. 
  A poetry performance about copper and cobalt mining, losing my mother, and ways that grief is a circuit, and how stones teach us about eternity. Perhaps maternal and ecological grief are a deep form of love, persisting. A huge thank you to Si-Min Chong for taking these photos!

  GARMENT
  A cold, 15-pound garment stitched together with Rhode Island river and beach stones. This garment is worn during the computer performance as an expression of embodied grief, and as an extension of the local ecologies.

    "content": `
  “there is no mineral of futurity” (2023) is a textile-based, photographic meditation on extractivism, technology, and the color blue. Through cyanotypes, the piece depicts error screens, cursors, glitches, alongside mining sites in Google satellite imagery and settler colonial cartographies. Among these are lithium mines in the American Southwest and cobalt mines in the Congo, both of which are crucial for battery production; the piece’s geographies also include a 19th century map of the largest copper mine in the world, based in Chile, which played a critical role in the dawn of electricity and electronics. 
  These cyanotype images were developed using solar power and iron-based pigment, which nods to photography’s material basis. Perhaps there is something about photography which pretends to be virtual as well, which creates what Susan Sontag calls a “fracturing, dislocating vision that only the camera supplies.” I would venture to say that language crops the world in such a way, too, notably within the technology of object recognition. And so the piece reckons not only with the geographies of extraction, but also its grammars. In this case, it references the surveillant, extractive gaze of artificial intelligence, skimming over the maps, and claiming, “NO OBJECT FOUND.”

  <i>on cyan</i> is an artist book of poetry which fixates on the perceptual, the optical, through the lens of color names. It refracts, it stalls, it attempts to match paint and paper to air. When folded out, the poem becomes a cyanometer, transparent and with swatches of blue descending in brightness.

  Perhaps in a medley of abstract plein air painting, field study, and poetry, the poem meditates on and tries to critique science figures like Alexander Humboldt (who sought to <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v41/n04/joyce-chaplin/blues-of-many-skies" target="_blank">measure the blue of the sky.</a>) It reflects on natural world’s capacity within as well as how it suffers from naming; the way dissections are incomplete and faltering; the complexity of everything even air refracting blue light.

    The poems themselves are concerned with sheerness, opacity, and color in classification systems.     I wonder at how scientific language grasps at knowledge; precisions it; pins it as a colonial found. Perhaps poetic gestures of annotation and collage introduce fog instead, and trouble the body of water which represents “scientific” epistemology.

  Internet Geology is a multimedia installation which highlights geographic sites of copper extraction and outlines the role of copper in technology and internet infrastructures. 
  
  Inspired by Fernando Godoy’s copper mine recordings, Trevor Paglen’s drone footage project, and Sam Lavigne’s web scrape of oil news, the digital projection combines sound, maps, government data, and poetry to play with the aesthetics of systemized extraction and "the field."

        MALDEN TRANSIT JUSTICE
        A zine I co-created and designed with Asian-American teenagers in Malden, MA, as part of a creative and civic literacy afterschool program.
        I was the teaching artist for Malden's Asian Community Development Corp in the spring of 2021. Together, we discussed how transit justice is also economic, environmental, and racial justice. I shared local histories of resisting displacement, as well as the beauty and power of maps and "countercartographies," which we made together. Students shared some of their ideas for a better Malden with the city council, as well as through their artwork, which is featured in this zine.

  How much does the internet weigh? How much data do we consume?<br>Are their landfills of information on the internet?
[intro_bytes_reduced.jpg]

  The Byte Catalog expresses the degree to which text in digital space is now so immense in scale, that our bodies fail to comprehend it. Language originally comes from the human body, and holds meaning within social, relational contexts. What happens at scale—when language transcends meaning, when data transcends body?
  This work began as a inquiry into the textual internet; over a semester, it evolved into a visceral experience of virtuality, including sculpture, video, and writing.

  <br><br>
  <span class="emph">1. VOLUME, WEIGHT</span>

  If our informational input could be measured in pounds, imagine how it would feel to literally consume or hold that much weight.

  In early explorations, I translated data into sculptural objects with mass to expand the abstract idea of "gigabyte" or "terabyte," into a sensory one.

  [dp_1.jpg]
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="emph">2. CONVERSION TOOLS</span>
  The human body understands the material world and has unique intuitions that help us navigate it. I was interested in how people would use intuition to convert their understanding of virtual units into physical objects.
I created interpretive “conversion tools”n the form of frames and boxes. Each of these symbolized a space for an assigned virtual unit where people’s responses/objects would live.
  [crowdsourced.jpg]


  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="emph">3. WRITING</span>
  Writing was an important part of my process and discovery. I generated about 1MB worth of text and images throughout this project. I populated that data into a <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzXTWcuY86iYcHFTREVrbVhrRzA/view?usp=sharing
' target='_blank'>process document</a> and a video (below).
  In the Byte Catalogue, I documented objects I crowd-sourced. I compared these against virtual experiences—for example, the Lord of the Rings trilogy in bytes.

  <span class="emph">4. OWNERSHIP OF VIRTUAL THINGS</span>

  <br>
  I allocated pixel acre-age on my site for people to own, with a corresponding deed modeled after traditional land deeds.
  [dp_3.jpg]


  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="emph">5. VIRTUAL WORLD</span>
  Eventually I collected enough to fill up a room with artifacts. I found textual objects and materials of different weights and densities and quantified them in bytes.
  The piece also featured sculptural metaphors like downloading across glass jars, as well as plastic physical hard-drives.

  //   <span class="emph">FINAL THOUGHTS</span>
  //   Despite the current abundance of jellyfish, do we have the right to steal them — even dead ones — from nature for our material desires?
  //   [pulmo_samples.jpg]
  //   We recognize that creating new biomaterials is not a substitute for urgent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal" target="_blank">policy</a> towards real environmental justice. Nor do we want to encourage future cycles of exploitation of abundance in order to deplete it.
  //   Our hope with this work is to illustrate effects of unsustainable supply chains on the ocean today — and to ask the audience to imagine how materials we use in the future can be more interoperable with our biological planet.

  //     A cross-seas collaboration with my friend Ying Cai.

  //     The embroidery (by me) tells two migration stories divided across economic class and held by culture. A garment worker in NYC Chinatown on the left; my mother designing semiconductors on the right. Both of them, immigrant people within a context of mass production.
  //
  //     In the center, a child who is born in America.
  //
  //     [me1.jpg]
  //
  //     The hand-dyed garment is made by Ying. She's so beautifully synthesized the Chinese Du-dou silhouette with the Western apron. The shape holds stories of domesticity, Confucian patriarchy, female labor.
  //     In her words, yellow is a strong but gentle color.

  //     Whose working immigrant bodies do we value through our language?
  //     Sometimes I find myself a tourist within my extended family's own cultural or class experience. In the broader Chinese diaspora, I feel sensitive to moments when way race unifies across class, and create moments of the familiar.

  //   <span class="emph">WHAT'S SCRATCH? </span>
  //   <a href="scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is an open-source programming language, creative tool, and online community used by millions of young people and educators around the world today.
  //   For many children, Scratch is their first experience in computational media and virtual community.

  // <br>
  //   <span class="emph">WHY THIS WORK? </span>

  //   Our previous join experience was text-heavy, less paced, and more utilitarian.
  //   [join 6.png]

  //   Scratch usage has been growing worldwide over the last few years. Often kids will be creating a new account as part of their classroom experience, or sometimes they will discover Scratch on their own.
  //   It felt crucial that we improve this first touch point – to emphasize a welcoming community, as well as the joy of building your first creative identity online.

  // <br>
  //   <span class="emph">NEW EXPERIENCE</span>
  //   I remember my first foray with internet communities over a decade ago, and how emotional that could be.
  //   We also recognize that we have a responsibility to onboard young people into internet community literacy — how to represent yourself online, while protecting your privacy.

  //   <a href="scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is an open-source programming language, creative tool, and online community used by millions of young people and educators around the world today.
  //    For many children, Scratch is their first experience in computational media and virtual community.
  //
  //  <br>
  //    <span class="emph">WHY THIS WORK?</span>
  //   Kids use the paint editor in Scratch to create stories, animations, games, and more. For many of them, Scratch is their first and only image editing software.
  //   Through the Scratch online community, young people share creations about themselves and their communities.
  //   [community2.gif]
  //   I wanted to lead this project because feel strongly about media representation generally; as a designer of creative tools, I'm especially passionate about our responsibilities to youth and their personal, expressive experiences.
  //
  // <br>
  //   <span class="emph">OUR EXISTING ARTWORK</span>
  //   Our team responded to how the existing characters in our asset library were sometimes difficult to reshape, or recolor. Here's an example project by a young person in the community, who has created their own work-arounds:
  //   [abby.gif]
  //
  //   We identified two main challenges:
  //   <span class="emph">1. RECOLORING.</span>
  //    Many of our existing assets, especially the bitmap characters, were difficult to recolor. For example, the hair contains multiple tones on this sprite.
  //   [hannah.gif]
  //   <span class="emph">2. RESHAPING.</span>
  //    Even for our vector assets, reposing characters were challenging because they were not designed with editability. For example, the outline and fill are constructed separately on this ballerina.
  //   [difficulty2.gif]
  //    This artwork was launched as part of a 3-month project I led and managed, with a focus on helping kids represent themselves in artwork.
  //   It was important to us that beginners — new to Scratch, new to image editing, or both — could quickly see themselves in the tool and community.
  //
  // <br>
  //   <span class="emph">NEW ARTWORK </span>
  //   As part of this project, we launched four new character sets for the Scratch Asset Library. You can see them all at <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor" target ="_blank">scratch.mit.edu</a> in the sprite library.
  //   Our team wanted to provide enough specificity through different options, as well as use simple shapes that could be easily altered and generalized.
  //
  //     [sprite2.png]
  //
  //   I drew this set of new vector characters. Now that they are in the Scratch Library, anyone can use them for their creative projects.
  //
  //   [sprite1-alt.png]
  //
  //   These character sets were built and grouped so they can be easily recolored or puppeted. Limb shapes are separated to move at the joint.
  //   [sprite5.png]
  //   [sprite3.gif]
  //
  //   Complex shapes like hair are left as groups of simple shapes — a strategy inspired by artists in the Scratch community.
  //
  //   Not only is it easier to modify, but also this offers an affordance on how vector illustrations are made.
  //
  //   [sprite4.png]
  //   [sprite4.gif]

  //   Here's some examples of the new sprites in use in the community:
